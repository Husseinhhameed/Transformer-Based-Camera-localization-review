## Problem Statement

Camera-based indoor localization is a fundamental aspect of indoor navigation, virtual reality, and location-based services. Deep learning methods have exhibited remarkable performance with low storage requirements and high efficiency. However, existing methods mainly derive features implicitly for pose regression without considering explicit structure information from images. This paper proposes that incorporating such information can improve the localization performance of learning-based approaches.

## Proposed Solution

This paper introduces a structure-guided camera localization method that extracts structure information from RGB images in the form of depth maps and edge maps. It designs two modules for depth-weighted and edge-weighted feature fusion, which are integrated into the pose regression network to enhance pose prediction. Furthermore, a self-attention module is employed for high-level feature extraction to augment the network's capacity.

## Model Structure

The proposed model comprises several key components:

### 1. Initial Feature Extraction

- Utilizes a ResNet50 backbone to extract multi-level features from RGB images.

### 2. Depth Weighted Input Residual Fusion (DWIRF)

- Extracts depth information from RGB images using a learnable auto-encoder structure.
- Fuses depth information with RGB features in a residual manner to emphasize key structural details.

### 3. Edge Attention-based Feature Residual Fusion (EAFRF)

- Derives edge information using a non-learnable edge detection module.
- Fuses edge information with RGB features to enhance feature maps with structural information.

### 4. Self-Attention (SA)

- Replaces the last residual block in ResNet50 with a self-attention module to adaptively emphasize features relevant for pose prediction.

### 5. Pose Regression (PR)

- Predicts the camera pose using three successive fully connected layers that regress the position and orientation from the fused features.

### 6. Loss Function

- Combines pose loss with depth estimation loss, weighted by a parameter to balance the contributions.

## Key Contributions

### 1. Structure Information Extraction

- Proposes extracting explicit structure information from RGB images to improve camera localization performance.

### 2. Novel Fusion Strategies

- Introduces depth-weighted and edge-weighted residual fusion methods to integrate structure information with RGB features.

### 3. Enhanced Pose Regression

- Employs a self-attention mechanism to improve high-level feature extraction, resulting in better pose prediction.

## Results

- **Datasets:** Evaluated on 7Scenes and 12Scenes datasets.
- **Performance:** Achieves high localization accuracy with an average positional error of 0.19 m on 7Scenes and 0.16 m on 12Scenes.

## Conclusion

The proposed structure-guided camera localization method effectively enhances pose prediction by integrating explicit structure information from RGB images. The use of depth-weighted and edge-weighted fusion, along with self-attention, results in a robust and efficient solution for indoor localization.

## Detailed Structure of the Model

### 1. Initial Feature Extraction

- **Backbone:** ResNet50, pretrained on ImageNet.

### 2. Depth Weighted Input Residual Fusion (DWIRF)

- **Depth Estimation:** Auto-encoder structure with skip connections to predict dense depth images.
- **Fusion Strategy:** Element-wise multiplication of depth and RGB images, followed by residual fusion to preserve key RGB features.

### 3. Edge Attention-based Feature Residual Fusion (EAFRF)

- **Edge Detection:** Non-learnable edge detection using Sobel operator.
- **Feature Fusion:** Aggregates edge information and fuses it with RGB features in a residual manner.

### 4. Self-Attention (SA)
