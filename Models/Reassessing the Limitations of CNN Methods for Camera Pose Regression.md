## Problem Statement

Camera pose estimation in both outdoor and indoor environments is a critical challenge in computer vision. Traditional methods, relying on 2D to 3D matching, are computationally intensive and often impractical for real-time applications. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as a potential solution, but they frequently underperform compared to the top-performing traditional methods due to their inability to generalize beyond the training data. This study aims to bridge this performance gap by addressing the inherent limitations in CNN-based regression methods for camera pose estimation.

## Proposed Solution

This paper introduces a novel approach to improve CNN-based camera pose regression by addressing data bias through a unique training technique. The method involves generating synthetic training views guided by a probability distribution derived from the training set. This technique aims to create a more diverse and unbiased set of training data, enabling the CNN to generalize better to new poses. Additionally, the paper proposes using a transformer-based architecture for relative pose regression to enhance performance further.

## Model Structure

The proposed model comprises the following key components:

### 1. Initial Feature Extraction

- Images are processed using a CNN (ResNet-34) to extract feature maps.
- These features are used to form training pairs, incorporating both real and synthetically generated images to improve the diversity of the training data.

### 2. Synthetic View Generation

- Synthetic views are created by perturbing the camera poses of the nearest neighbors in the training set, following a multi-variate Gaussian distribution.
- A combination of dense predicted depths and sparse MVS depths is used to generate high-quality synthetic images.

### 3. Relative Pose Regression Transformer

- The model uses a transformer encoder to process pairs of image embeddings (query and nearest neighbor).
- The transformer predicts the relative rotation (quaternion) and translation between the image pairs, which are then used to compute the absolute camera pose.

### 4. Loss Function

- A weighted L1-loss is used to supervise the relative pose predictions, balancing the rotation and translation errors.

## Key Contributions

### 1. Novel Training Technique

- Introduces a probability-driven method for generating synthetic training views to reduce data bias and improve generalization.

### 2. Transformer-Based Architecture

- Utilizes a transformer encoder for relative pose regression, showing superior performance compared to traditional MLP approaches.

### 3. Improved Performance

- Demonstrates significant improvements in camera pose estimation accuracy over existing regression-based methods on challenging benchmarks.

## Results

- Evaluated on Cambridge Landmarks and 7Scenes datasets.
- Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of median translation and rotation errors.
- Shows robust performance in large-scale outdoor scenes, such as the "Street" scene in the Cambridge Landmarks dataset.

## Detailed Structure of the Model

### 1. Initial Feature Extraction

- The ResNet-34 architecture, pretrained on ImageNet, is used to extract feature embeddings from input images.

### 2. Synthetic View Generation

- Gaussian perturbations are applied to the nearest neighbor poses to create synthetic views.
- Depth maps from MVS and predicted dense depths are fused to generate high-quality synthetic images.

### 3. Relative Pose Regression Transformer

- The transformer encoder processes the embeddings of image pairs, predicting the relative pose between them.
- Positional encoding is concatenated with the image embeddings before inputting them into the transformer.

### 4. Loss Function

- The loss function combines position loss $( L_x \)$ and orientation loss $( L_q \)$, with learnable parameters to balance the two.

## Training and Implementation

### Optimization

- The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a geometrically annealed learning rate.

### Data Augmentation

- Includes rescaling, cropping, and normalization of input images.

### Hardware

- Implemented in PyTorch and trained on a machine with an Intel i7 processor and Nvidia GeForce GPU.

By addressing the limitations of CNN-based regression methods and leveraging a transformer architecture, this approach offers a more robust and accurate solution for camera pose estimation in various environments.
