## Problem Statement

Visual localization is critical to many applications in computer vision and robotics. Traditional feature-based methods for single-image RGB localization match local descriptors between a query image and a pre-built 3D model. However, these methods face challenges in large and ambiguous environments. Deep neural networks have been explored to map raw pixels to 3D scene coordinates directly, but these methods struggle with large environments due to limited receptive fields and overfitting.

## Proposed Solution

This paper introduces HSCNet++, an extension of HSCNet, which predicts pixel scene coordinates in a coarse-to-fine manner from a single RGB image. HSCNet++ utilizes a transformer-based conditioning mechanism to encode global context into local representations efficiently, improving coordinate prediction at all levels. The method allows for training compact models that scale robustly to large environments, achieving state-of-the-art performance for single-image localization on the 7-Scenes, 12-Scenes, and Cambridge Landmarks datasets.

## Model Structure

The proposed model comprises several key components:

### 1. Initial Feature Extraction

- Uses a fully convolutional network (FCN) to map input images to dense feature tensors representing the image appearance.

### 2. Hierarchical Scene Coordinate Prediction

- Predicts scene coordinates progressively in a coarse-to-fine manner, with predictions corresponding to regions and sub-regions in the scene, and coordinate residuals at the finest level.

### 3. Transformer-Based Conditioning

- Utilizes transformer encoders that integrate inherent and implicit region and sub-region information without requiring conventional position encodings.

### 4. FiLM Conditioning Layers

- Applies FiLM conditioning layers to encode predicted region and sub-region information into follow-up branches.

### 5. Loss Function

- Combines classification and regression losses, including symmetric cross-entropy loss for robustness and reprojection loss for noise rectification.

## Key Contributions

1. **Transformer-Based Conditioning:** Efficiently encodes global spatial information for improved scene coordinate prediction.
2. **Pseudo-Labeling for Sparse Supervision:** Introduces a pseudo-labeling method for handling sparse ground truth data, improving applicability to outdoor scenes.
3. **Improved Performance:** Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks while reducing the memory footprint.

## Results

- **Datasets:** Evaluated on 7-Scenes, 12-Scenes, and Cambridge Landmarks datasets.
- **Performance:** Demonstrates significant performance improvements, achieving higher localization accuracy and setting new state-of-the-art results.

## Conclusion

HSCNet++ provides a robust and efficient solution for visual localization by leveraging hierarchical scene coordinate classification and regression with transformers. This approach effectively handles large environments and sparse data, setting new benchmarks in single-image RGB localization.
