## Problem Statement

Recent learning-based approaches have achieved impressive results in single-shot camera localization. However, the best methods to fuse multiple modalities (e.g., image and depth) and deal with degraded or missing input are less well studied. Previous approaches towards deep fusion do not significantly outperform models employing a single modality due to naive feature space fusion methods that do not consider the different strengths of each modality.

## Proposed Solution

This paper proposes VMLoc, an end-to-end framework that fuses different sensor inputs into a common latent space through a variational Product-of-Experts (PoE) followed by attention-based fusion. Unlike previous multimodal variational works that directly adapt the objective function of vanilla variational auto-encoders, this work introduces an unbiased objective function based on importance weighting to accurately estimate camera localization.

## Model Structure

The proposed model comprises several key components:

### 1. Initial Feature Extraction

- Uses separate feature encoders for RGB images and depth images, specifically ResNet34 for RGB images and a depth encoder for depth maps.

### 2. Variational Fusion Module

- Employs a Product-of-Experts (PoE) approach to learn a joint latent representation from RGB and depth modalities.

### 3. Attention-Based Fusion

- Applies self-attention to the joint latent representation to focus on important features for pose estimation.

### 4. Pose Regression

- Uses a pose regressor with fully connected layers to predict the 6-DoF camera pose from the fused features.

### 5. Loss Function

- Combines a geometric loss for pose estimation and an unbiased objective function based on importance weighting for multimodal fusion.

## Key Contributions

1. **Variational Fusion Module:** Introduces a PoE fusion module to learn a common latent space from different sensor modalities.
2. **Unbiased Objective Function:** Proposes an unbiased objective function based on importance weighting to improve pose estimation accuracy.
3. **State-of-the-Art Performance:** Demonstrates the effectiveness of the VMLoc framework through extensive experiments on RGB-D datasets.

## Results

- **Datasets:** Evaluated on the 7-Scenes and Oxford RobotCar datasets.
- **Performance:** Achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both position and orientation errors, significantly outperforming existing methods.

## Conclusion

VMLoc presents a robust and efficient solution for multimodal camera localization by leveraging variational fusion and attention mechanisms. This approach effectively fuses RGB and depth data, enhancing localization accuracy and robustness in various environments.
