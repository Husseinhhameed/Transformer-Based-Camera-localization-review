## Problem Statement

Accurate indoor visual localization has been a challenging task under large-view scenes with wide baselines and weak texture images, where it is difficult to accomplish accurate image matching. Traditional methods often struggle with feature mismatching due to ambiguous patterns caused by visual similarity, leading to errors in visual localization.

## Proposed Solution

This paper proposes a novel coarse-to-fine feature matching model using a transformer, termed MSFA-T, which assigns corresponding semantic labels to image features for an initial coarse matching. A multiscale forward attention mechanism is introduced to learn the specificity of sparse features, reducing the impact of position-independence on sparse features and improving fine image matching accuracy in visual localization.

## Model Structure

The proposed model comprises several key components:

### 1. Initial Feature Extraction

- Utilizes the D2-Net model to extract CNN features and positions from the input images.

### 2. Semantic Mapping for Coarse Matching

- Assigns semantic labels to image features for coarse matching by performing pixel-level semantic segmentation.

### 3. Multiscale Forward Attention Module (MSFA)

- Smooths anomalous attention scores by using self-attention weights from the previous moment to the current moment.
- Utilizes different sizes of convolution filters to model feature units at different scales and obtain target feature vectors.

### 4. Refined Matching and Loss Function

- Calculates the score matrix between output features and applies softmax and Mutual Nearest Neighbor (MNN) criteria for refined matching.
- Combines coarse-level and fine-level losses to improve matching accuracy.

## Key Contributions

1. **Coarse-to-Fine Feature Matching:** Solves the problem of sparse feature matching in large view scenes by utilizing semantic match consistency and position correlation.
2. **Multiscale Forward Attention Mechanism:** Reduces the impact of anomalous scoring of sparse feature interrelationship and attention weight on different image patches.
3. **Improved Performance:** Achieves an average correct matching rate of 79.8% in large view scenes and reduces localization error by 9.5% in wide baseline scenes.

## Results

- **Datasets:** Evaluated on challenging datasets including ScanNet, MegaDepth, HPatches, and InLoc.
- **Performance:** Outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in image matching and visual localization, achieving significant improvements in matching accuracy and localization performance.

## Conclusion

MSFA-T presents a robust and efficient solution for sparse feature matching in large-view indoor visual localization. By integrating semantic information and a multiscale forward attention mechanism, the model effectively improves matching accuracy and visual localization performance in challenging scenarios with weak textures and wide baselines.
