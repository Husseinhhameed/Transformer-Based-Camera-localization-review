## Problem Statement

Camera pose estimation is crucial for various computer vision applications such as indoor navigation, augmented reality, and autonomous driving. Traditional methods, like hierarchical localization pipelines, are accurate but slow and require significant memory and connectivity. Absolute pose regressors (APRs) offer a faster, lightweight alternative by estimating the camera pose using only the query image, but they typically lack accuracy and are designed for single scenes. Multi-scene APRs aim to overcome these limitations by learning from multiple scenes simultaneously, but they have not matched the accuracy of single-scene approaches.

## Proposed Solution

This paper introduces a transformer-based approach for multi-scene absolute pose regression. The method employs separate positional and orientational transformer encoders to aggregate informative features from activation maps generated by a convolutional backbone. Decoders then transform these features and scene encodings into candidate pose predictions. This architecture allows the model to generalize across multiple scenes while maintaining high accuracy and efficiency.

## Model Structure

The proposed model consists of several components:

### 1. Initial Feature Extraction

- An EfficientNet-B0 convolutional backbone extracts activation maps at two different resolutions for position and orientation regression.

### 2. Transformer Encoders

- Separate encoders for positional and orientational features, each processing the flattened activation maps with positional encodings to maintain spatial information.

### 3. Transformer Decoders

- Decoders generate latent pose representations for each scene, with outputs classified to select the respective scene embeddings for pose regression.

### 4. Loss Function

- Combines position and orientation loss with a Negative Log Likelihood (NLL) loss term for scene classification, balancing the errors with learned parameters.

## Key Contributions

### 1. Multi-Scene Transformer Architecture

- Applies transformers to aggregate task-specific features and embed multiple scenes, improving pose estimation accuracy across diverse environments.

### 2. Positional and Orientational Encoders

- Uses separate transformers for position and orientation, enhancing the extraction of informative image cues.

### 3. State-of-the-Art Performance

- Achieves superior accuracy for both multi-scene and single-scene APRs on benchmark datasets, demonstrating robustness and efficiency.

## Results

- Evaluated on Cambridge Landmarks and 7Scenes datasets.
- Outperforms MSPN and other APRs in terms of median position and orientation errors.
- Demonstrates strong performance across indoor and outdoor localization challenges.

## Detailed Structure of the Model

### 1. Initial Feature Extraction

- EfficientNet-B0 extracts activation maps at resolutions 14x14x112 and 28x28x40 for position and orientation transformers, respectively.

### 2. Transformer Encoders

- Flatten activation maps, add positional encodings, and process them through multi-head attention and MLP layers.

### 3. Transformer Decoders

- Use self-attention and encoder-decoder attention to generate latent embeddings for each scene.
- Scene classification selects the appropriate embeddings for pose regression.

### 4. Loss Function

- Combines position loss (\( L_x \)), orientation loss (\( L_q \)), and NLL loss for scene classification.
- Loss parameters are optimized to balance the different error components.

## Training and Implementation

### Optimization

- Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of \( 10^{-4} \).

### Data Augmentation

- Includes rescaling, cropping, and normalization.

### Hardware

- Implemented in PyTorch, trained on an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 GPU.
