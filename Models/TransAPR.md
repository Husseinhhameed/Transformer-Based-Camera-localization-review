**Problem Statement**

Visual relocalization aims to estimate the absolute camera pose from an image or sequential images. This task is crucial for applications like robotics, autonomous driving, and augmented reality. Traditional methods based on 3D geometry are computationally intensive and often struggle with large perspective, illumination, or dynamic changes. Recent deep learning approaches using neural networks for pose regression have shown promise but still face challenges in exploiting spatial and temporal clues from sequential images, leading to inaccurate poses and large outliers.

**Proposed Solution**

This paper introduces TransAPR, a vision Transformer-based absolute pose regression model that leverages spatial and temporal attention mechanisms to improve the accuracy and robustness of camera pose estimation. The model uses a CNN backbone to extract image features, which are then processed by Transformer-based spatial and temporal fusion modules to enhance feature interaction among neighboring images. Additionally, a hierarchical feature aggregation (HFA) module aggregates multi-scale and multi-level features in the pose regressor, resulting in reliable image representations for pose regression.

**Model Structure**

The TransAPR model consists of several key components:

**1. Initial Feature Extraction:**

- Utilizes a pre-trained CNN (such as ResNet) to extract feature maps from input images.

**2. Spatial and Temporal Fusion:**

- Transformer-based spatial fusion module processes spatial features to capture global context.
- Transformer-based temporal fusion module integrates features from sequential images to enhance temporal consistency.

**3. Hierarchical Feature Aggregation (HFA):**

- Aggregates multi-scale and multi-level features from the CNN backbone.
- Concatenates and processes features through MLPs and pooling layers to generate robust representations for position and orientation regression.

**4. Pose Regressor:**

- Uses different features for position and orientation regression, employing separate heads to handle the specific requirements of each task.
- Incorporates temporal constraints in position prediction and hierarchical feature aggregation for orientation prediction.

**Key Contributions**

**1. Novel Transformer-based Architecture:**

- Introduces spatial and temporal fusion modules that leverage Transformer encoders to improve feature interaction and capture global context.

**2. Hierarchical Feature Aggregation:**

- Proposes an HFA module that effectively combines multi-scale and multi-level features, enhancing the model's ability to generate reliable representations for pose regression.

**3. State-of-the-Art Performance:**

- Achieves superior performance on various indoor and outdoor datasets, demonstrating robustness and accuracy in challenging environments.

**Results**

- **Datasets:** Evaluated on indoor (7Scenes) and outdoor (Cambridge Landmarks) datasets.
- **Performance:** Outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of translation and rotation errors, showing robust localization under varying conditions.

**Detailed Structure of TransAPR Model**

**1. Initial Feature Extraction:**

- The pre-trained CNN backbone (e.g., ResNet) extracts feature maps at multiple scales.

**2. Spatial and Temporal Fusion:**

- **Spatial Fusion:** Processes feature maps with a spatial Transformer to capture global spatial context.
- **Temporal Fusion:** Integrates sequential features using a temporal Transformer to maintain temporal consistency.

**3. Hierarchical Feature Aggregation (HFA):**

- **Feature Processing:** Multi-scale feature maps from the CNN are processed through pooling layers and MLPs.
- **Concatenation and Addition:** Features from different scales and levels are concatenated and combined to produce robust embeddings.

**4. Pose Regressor:**

- **Position Head:** Uses high-level features from the temporal Transformer for position prediction.
- **Orientation Head:** Employs the HFA block to integrate multi-scale features for orientation prediction.

**Training and Implementation**

- **Optimization:** The model is trained using the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of $(10^{-4}\)$.
- **Data Augmentation:** Includes rescaling, cropping, and normalization of input images.
- **Hardware:** Implemented in PyTorch, trained on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 GPU.

By leveraging spatial and temporal attention mechanisms and hierarchical feature aggregation, TransAPR provides a robust and accurate solution for absolute camera pose regression, setting a new benchmark in the field.
